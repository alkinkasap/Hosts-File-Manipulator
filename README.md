# Hosts-File-Manipulator
This tkinter app manipulates hosts file. 


Written in python, using tkinter. Command line interface must be run in admin mode. Just run the file and voila.

Used some sort of dark theme. Add and remove functions works as expected. Comments doesnt change via edit function, is not a neccesity for me so left it that way for now. 

If you convert it into a full gui app with pyinstaller or something Windows will treat it as a evil virus. You can allow it, up to you.
